# Nertivia Wrapper [Deprecated]

This is an older project of mine (~2021-2022) destined to offer an easy way to communicate with the Nertivia (https://github.com/SupertigerDev/nertivia-client-ts) wrapper.

It was built before an API change occurred, making this project require a heavy overhaul to remain compatible.

It is in no way proper due to its short life, but remains for archiving purposes.
